                                    Products ordered through website for delivery within India are shipped through our courier partner if the delivery service to the destination is available. In absence of courier service to the desired location, the products are shipped through Indian Postal Service.
                                    Shipping to locations outside India is done through Indian Postal Service.
                                    International Book Post shipping requires us to ship books in open envelop and is not registered. Therefore, we will not be in a position to provide a tracking number.
                                    The shipping time mentioned anywhere on the website are approximate and we can not guarantee them. Customers are recommended to place an order early on if they have a deadline to meet.
                                    Apart from the shipping time, the print on demand books also need 4-7 business days for production.
