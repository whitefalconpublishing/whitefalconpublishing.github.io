                                             Book cover is the face of a book. The face has to represent the true character and voice of the work it stands for. Hence, book cover design is an important task to be accomplished carefully to make the book a success. In basic cover design, we find suitable images matching the content from various stock photo repositories and provide the author with a variety of templates/designs to choose from.
                                             Aspects of the book cover touched include: front cover, title design, spine, back cover including book summary and author biography and ISBN barcode.

The intent of the sentences is not modified. No attempt is made to tamper with the writing style of the author. The simplicity of the sentences is maintained as-is. 
                                            Proofreading is done after the interior is designed with the edited text. 
                                            Proofreading is done to ensure there are absolutely no errors or typos in the composed interior file.

                                            <p>An author makes quite an effort to write and compile a book. Once the book is published, the next important step is to increase its visibility amongst the audience. Media coverage in newspapers is very effective for this purpose.

                                            in association with our PR partner agencies, whereby author shares his/her views about the book and

Quite old and not so old books can be found figuring on the book-selling sites with a tag - out of stock/print. Authors who lost their books at the hands of their publishers years ago, can revive their precious books with us. This service is not only beneficial to the authors but also to students, readers who desperately wish to acquire such books. We re-compose the old book by modernizing its interior and cover. Once it's print-ready, we publish the book and make it available on various online distribution channels.
