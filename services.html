                                             Book cover is the face of a book. The face has to represent the true character and voice of the work it stands for. Hence, book cover design is an important task to be accomplished carefully to make the book a success. In basic cover design, we find suitable images matching the content from various stock photo repositories and provide the author with a variety of templates/designs to choose from.
                                             Aspects of the book cover touched include: front cover, title design, spine, back cover including book summary and author biography and ISBN barcode.

                                            In Basic editing, we correct grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, punctuation, inappropriate length of the sentences and jargons. The intent of the sentences is not modified. No attempt is made to tamper with the writing style of the author. The simplicity of the sentences is maintained as-is. 
                                            Proofreading is done after the interior is designed with the edited text. 
                                            Proofreading is done to ensure there are absolutely no errors or typos in the composed interior file.

                                            <p>In Comprehensive editing, the editor not only corrects any obvious errors (grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and punctuation), but also rewrites sentences and paragraphs, if required to remove inconsistencies and ambiguities. 
                                            The editor uses his/her expertise to ensure that the document makes sense, and the text is clearer and more understandable.

                                            We offer two options for distribution of books to physical retail stores across India -
<h3>1. Distributors</h3> Sample copies of the book are sent to renowned book distributors for evaluation purpose. Most book distributors are engaged in distribution of books in a specific genre only (fiction, non-fiction, academic, etc.). Hence, based on the book genre, sample copies need to be sent to relevant distributors. Upon qualification of the book, the required number of copies are printed and shipped to the distributor for pan-India distribution. As most of the distributors accept books on Sale or Return (SOR) basis, upfront investment is required to print the copies. The cost of printing of such copies is borne by the Author. Distributors will send the books to bookstores across India. 
Distributors will report all the books sold on a biannual or annual basis. The author will be paid royalty for the books sold. 
All unsold inventory will be supplied back to the author upon expiry of the distribution period agreed with the distributor. 
<br><br>
<h3>2. Retail-Direct</h3>We have tied up with 200+ bookstores in 24 Indian states. Individual copies are supplied to such stores for evaluation purpose. Depending upon the response to the book, bookstores can place orders for copies with us. Such number of copies are printed and shipped to respective stores across the country. Author must bear the cost of sample copies to be sent to the bookstores. For all the subsequent orders placed by the bookstores upon review of the sample copies, the authors will be paid royalty.

                                            <p>We come across so many books of interest to us, but to our vain, they are out of print. Quite old and not so old books can be found figuring on the book-selling sites with a tag - out of stock/print. Authors who lost their books at the hands of their publishers years ago, can revive their precious books with us. This service is not only beneficial to the authors but also to students, readers who desperately wish to acquire such books. We re-compose the old book by modernizing its interior and cover. Once it's print-ready, we publish the book and make it available on various online distribution channels.
