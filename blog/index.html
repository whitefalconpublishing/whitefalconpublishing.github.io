                        <p class="margin-b-20">Since its inception in the year 2007, self publishing has come a long way. We see more and more writers choosing this route to publish their books. With this increase, the number of firms offering self publishing services is also on the rise. Self publishing offers ease of access to bring out one’s book in the market. Traditional model of publishing has always been time-consuming, evaluation-based with lesser transparency in terms of sales figures. All these cons are taken care of in self publishing.</p>

                        <p class="margin-b-20">At the onset of a new era inpublishing when more and more voices are being heard, when new hidden gems and stories are unearthed every day, which may have never seen the light of the day, I’m sure you have a story to telltoo, an experience to share, an urge to paint the sky with your ink. Yes, I’m talking about self-publishing, which has come a long way in a very shortwhile but has an even longer journey to make.</p>

                        <p class="margin-b-20">If you think writing a book is difficult, wait till you start making efforts to get it published – writing would seem to be a walk in the park in comparison. If you are planning to write a book, or in the process of writing one, or already have a manuscript ready, then I’m sure you would be struggling with the dilemma of whether to take the traditional publishing route or go for self-publishing. Being a recently published author who has dealt with both types of publishers, I think I am an ideal candidate for drawing a comparison between traditional publishing and self-publishing.</p>

With technological advancements in full swing, in our age, we quite often love to immerse ourselves into the new, imaginative, and creative realms created by the thinkers, visionaries, and dreamers that rock the world every now and then by their ideas. So many of the science fiction fantasies are common realities now. But there is one, about which it has been written since time immemorial, ever since there has been science and fiction, and has not been achieved yet. It still intrigues our minds no matter how many times we come across that same old concept - The Time Travel! It never fails to catch our attention.</p>

Your words will travel to places unknown, to people unknown, and to times unknown. They will, most likely, continue to exist even after you. And believe me, with the current trends of self-destruction around the world, they may even be the last vestige of mankind!</p>

Whatever you read is useful, be it - newspapers, magazines, novels, technical papers, economics, history, literature, science, spiritual, etc. Nevertheless, there are certain points you can keep in mind while choosing to read, especially ‘for’ writing.</p>
