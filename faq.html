				Self publishing is the new model for book publishing. In this model, the author is the publisher of his book. The copyright of the book vests with the author. Author can avail the services of various professional service providers for making his manuscript print-ready and available online.
                                <br><br>
								
				<li><span><h3>What are the various types of self-publishing models?</h3></span></li>  
				
			1.       Subsidy based - The author pays for the book’s printing and binding process. The publisher pays for a portion of the cost of edit, distribute and market the book.<br>
                                2.       Vanity based – The author pays for all the services and owns the book and receives all profits directly.<br>
                                3.       Self-publishing based – The author pays to produce, market, distribute and stock the book.<br>
                                4.       Print on Demand – Authors can make their book available online without any minimum purchase guarantee. Author can order even a single book.

			White Falcon Publishing provides all relevant author services at the most reasonable prices. A variety of plans are provided for the ease of the author. However, it isn’t mandatory for one to choose only the plan and get stuck, even if certain services aren’t required. We also provide custom plans to facilitate you to get your book published. The author is not mandated to purchase any copy of the book. You pay only for the publishing services. White Falcon Publishing also provides various marketing services.

			<li><span><h3>What type of paper is used for interior and paperback covers?</h3></span></li>
			For black & white interior, we use 70-80 GSM White/Natural Shade paper. For colored interiors we use 130-170 GSM art paper. 
                                For paperback covers we use 250-280 GSM art-board. The quality of books published is superior than most traditionally published books. 
			<br><br>
			
			
			<li><span><h3>In what format do we require the book files from the author?</h3></span></li>
			We accept MS Word files, PDFs, even old books that authors wish to be re-published. Author need not worry about the format or composition of his book. Let our professionals handle that.
			<br><br>
			
			<li><span><h3>What is the minimum number of pages required to form a book?</h3></span></li>
			Minimum 50 pages is the limit to get a book published.
			<br><br>
			<li><span><h3>How is print-on-demand different from offset printing?</h3></span></li>
			Print-on-demand is a digital printing technology which allows even a single copy to be printed and the cost 
			of printing is independent of the number of copies being printed.
			In contrast to print-on-demand, offset printing involves a fixed setup cost for creating the plates (usually made of metal) from which ink is transferred onto a rubber sheet, which in turn is rolled onto paper being fed through a press. The large sheets of printed paper are then cut bound to form a book. Offset printing is economical only for bulk printing and the printing cost per book decreases with the number of copies being printed. 
			
			<br><br>
			<li><span><h3>What is the benefit of print-on-demand over offset printing?</h3></span></li>
			Since print-on-demand allows even a single copy to be printed, neither the publisher nor the author has to 
			make a significant investment in bulk printing of copies. Revisions in books can be done, as the copies are printed on-demand as and when the orders come in. 
			Offset printing, on the other hand, requires a significant investment for bulk printing of copies.
			
			<br><br>
			
			<li><span><h3>Do you go for print-on-demand or offest printing if authors need bulk copies?</h3></span></li>
			If authors require bulk copies for their personal use and distributing them to their friends/colleagues, 
			the same can be provided at the printing cost. For orders upto 1000 copies, print-on-demand is economical.
			For larger quantities, we can get offest printing done.

			<li><span><h3>Do you make books available in physical book stores throughout the country?</h3></span></li>

			up the book for distribution, we can supply the books under certain conditions.
