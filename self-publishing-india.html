									<h2>Publish your book through self publishing model</h2>
										</header>
										
										
<p>
														Self publishing can be defined as the process of getting your manuscript out in the market, all by yourself! In other words, you can publish your books, market them and sell them. Self publishing has come as a boon for people who dream of publishing a book, one day. Traditional publishers have been selective in publishing books that, according to them, can sell millions. Hence, amateurs have had to confront rejections. Still, people with a fire in them, to write, never ever gave up writing! For a passion, always remains a passion, it never subsides, come what may. Book publishing in India is set to explode with the new model of self-publishing. Self publishing is enabled by print on demand (POD) technology. In print-on-demand (POD) publishing, new copies of a book are printed as and when orders come in. 
														<br><br>
														<h3>Benefits of Self Publishing</h3>
Self publishing is an alternative and a better publishing option for authors, famous or new. Self publishing has many advantages to offer for writers of all kinds –
Better control on the content since author owns the copyright<br>
Author provides suggestions at each step of the book composition and publishing process<br>
Author can get the book published through other publishers/service providers depending upon varied distribution/geographical location/higher royalty/etc.<br>
No upfront book publishing/printing costs are incurred<br>
Author pays only for the services availed – Cover design, Interior design, Account set-up, Marketing, Bulk copies, etc.<br>
No upfront printing of copies takes place. Self publishing has a unique aspect called Print-on-Demand – the book is printed by the POD printers only when an order is placed on the online distribution channels. Thus, author is not asked to pay fully or partially for bulk printing and stocking of books, as seen in the case of traditional publishing.<br>
<br>
